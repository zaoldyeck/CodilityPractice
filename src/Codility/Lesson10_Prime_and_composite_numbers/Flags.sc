//TODO: one more time
//A peak is an array element which is larger
//than its neighbours.
//
//For example, the following array A:
//A[0] = 1 A[1] = 5 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 4
//A[4] = 3 A[5] = 4 A[6] = 1 A[7] = 2
//A[8] = 3 A[9] = 4 A[10] = 6 A[11] = 2
//
//has exactly four peaks: elements 1, 3, 5 and 10.
//
//Flags can only be set on peaks. What's more, if you take
//K flags, then the distance between any two flags should be
//greater than or equal to K. The distance between indices
//P and Q is the absolute value |P âˆ’ Q|.

//two flags, you can set them on peaks 1 and 5;
//three flags, you can set them on peaks 1, 5 and 10;
//four flags, you can set only three flags, on peaks 1, 5 and 10.
//
//You can therefore set a maximum of three flags in this case.
