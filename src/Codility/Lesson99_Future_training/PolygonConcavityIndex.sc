//A polygon is convex if and only if, for any edge of the polygon,
//all vertices belong to the semiplane whose boundary contains the edge.
//
//For example, the polygon consisting of vertices whose Cartesian
// coordinates are consecutively:
//(-1, 3)   (3, 1)   (0, -1)   (-2, 1)
//is convex.
//
//The convex hull of a finite set of points in a 2D plane is the smallest convex polygon
//that contains all points in this set. For example, the convex hull of a set
//consisting of six points whose Cartesian coordinates are:
//
//(-1, 3)   (3, 1)   (1, 1)
//(0, -1)   (-2, 1)  (-1, 2)
//is a polygon that has four vertices. When traversed clockwise, its vertices are:
//(-1, 3)   (3, 1)   (0, -1)   (-2, 1)
